# Data_fusion is a project designed to implement a novel algorithm for NDVI sentinel and Landsat data fusion.
## This repo contains three folders and training notebooks.
* "Content" folder has a google drive link to necessary data set used in this project.
* "test_code" folder consists of notebooks which produce the results on test dataset using pre traineid machine learning models (Random Forest, LSTM and CNN)
* "trained_models" folder consists of models file(json and h5) which was the result of hours of training of LSTM, RF and CNN.
* The individual notebook in the repo are the code used to built these model. Among these notebook, Random Forest (RF_) notebook consists of trained model only (No test cases) while other notebooks consists of training as well as evaluation for Nepal cases.
